# Bee Hive Monitoring System - Polytech Sorbonne

## Project Context

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Bee Hive Monitoring System project, an innovative initiative by engineering students at Polytech Sorbonne in the Ei-2i-4 program. This project is designed to address the alarming global decline in bee populations due to Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) and other environmental stresses.

### Background

Since 1998, CCD has been a major issue in France and across Europe, characterized by the sudden and massive disappearance of bees from hives, particularly at the end of winter or sometimes during mid-summer. The syndrome has devastating implications not only for beekeepers but also for the global ecosystem, considering the critical role of bees as pollinators. Essential crops such as apples, almonds, avocados, and many others are at risk due to the declining bee populations, as these crops heavily rely on bee pollination.

### Objectives

Our project aims to develop a sophisticated monitoring system embedded within beehives to continuously track environmental and biological factors affecting bee colonies. The primary objectives of this system include:

- Environmental Monitoring: To measure real-time data on temperature, humidity, and other atmospheric conditions that could influence hive health.
- Predator Detection: To identify the presence of predators like the Varroa mite and Asian hornet, which are known to cause significant harm to bee colonies.
- Chemical Surveillance: To detect the presence of harmful chemicals, including widely-used insecticides that have been linked to bee mortality.

### Technical Approach

The system utilizes an array of sensors integrated within the hives, coupled with data analytics tools to process and visualize the data. These include:

- Temperature and Humidity Sensors: To monitor climate conditions inside and around the hive.
- Motion Sensors: For detecting unusual activity that may indicate the presence of predators.
- Chemical Sensors: Capable of identifying trace levels of toxic substances in the environment.
- Data Analysis: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict potential threats and health issues based on collected data.
