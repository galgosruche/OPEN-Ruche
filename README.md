## Project Context

Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is a phenomenon of abnormal and persistent mortality of domestic bees, observed in France and throughout Europe since 1998. It is characterized by a sudden and massive disappearance of bees from hives, usually at the end of winter, sometimes in the middle of summer. In the United States, about 25% of the bee population was lost during the winter of 2006-2007, and many European countries have also been affected since the 2000s. Locally, losses can reach up to 90% of colonies. Winter mortality rates of domestic bee colonies, since the emergence of this phenomenon, far exceed the previously observed rate of about 10%.

This syndrome raises great concern among beekeepers, as well as among many ecologists, economists, and experts, due to the crucial importance of bees as pollinators. Indeed, many crops such as apple trees, almond trees, avocado trees, cherry trees, onions, cucumbers, cotton, peanuts, melons, etc., rely heavily (90% to 100%) on bee pollination. According to INRA, the survival of 80% of flowering plants and the production of 35% of human food directly depend on pollinators.

Today, bees are faced with several threats, including new predators such as the varroa mite and the Asian hornet, as well as insecticides, hive theft, and climate change. The varroa mite was first observed in France in 1982 and in Belgium in 1984. Originating from East Asia, this mite parasit
